Keep track of the percentage gain/loss performance of up to 12 stocks in your portfolio 

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to track the performance of up to 12 positions in percentage terms.  In addition to tickers and cost basis, you can  also provide a custom URL for each position and a title for the widget.  Finally, you can decide to track the month the trade was entered, as we do with our 821 model trade, or to display the cost basis instead.

Although, built to “scratch my own itch”, I hope some of you will find this plug-in useful as well!
